---- Begin "resurrect"

First, stick this into your limbo.are:

#MOBOLD
#1
zombie~
a zombie~
A zombie is here, slaving away for its master.
~
This zombie has a blank look on its face.  Rest assured, it wouldn't stir if
you held a knife to its throat.
~

The mob is old format because otherwise I'd have to reassign the damage 
for it... something I really didn't feel like doing, since I couldn't 
come up with a decent formula.  If it's old format damage is simply 
calculated by level.

Stick this in merc.h among the mob vnums:

#define MOB_VNUM_ZOMBIE		1

In magic.h, among the DECLARE_SPELL_FUN's:

DECLARE_SPELL_FUN(	spell_resurrect		);

In const.c, in the skill_table:

    {
	"resurrect",		{ 53, 53, 53, 53 },	{ 1,  1,  2,  2},
	spell_resurrect,	TAR_IGNORE,		POS_STANDING,
	NULL,			SLOT(xxx),	100,	15,
	"",			"!Resurrect!",		"",
    },

Of course, you will want to lower the levels and change SLOT(xxx) to a 
free spell slot.

And now, the spell function... stick this in magic.c:

void spell_resurrect( int sn, int level, CHAR_DATA *ch, void *vo,int target)
{
    OBJ_DATA *obj;
    CHAR_DATA *mob;
    int i;

    obj = get_obj_here( ch, target_name );

    if ( obj == NULL )
    {
        send_to_char( "Resurrect what?\n\r", ch );
        return;
    }

    /* Nothing but NPC corpses. */

    if( obj->item_type != ITEM_CORPSE_NPC )
    {
        if( obj->item_type == ITEM_CORPSE_PC )
            send_to_char( "You can't resurrect players.\n\r", ch );
        else
            send_to_char( "It would serve no purpose...\n\r", ch );
        return;
    }

    if( obj->level > (ch->level + 2) )
    {
        send_to_char( "You couldn't call forth such a great spirit.\n\r", ch );
        return;
    }

    if( ch->pet != NULL )
    {
        send_to_char( "You already have a pet.\n\r", ch );
        return;
    }

    /* Chew on the zombie a little bit, recalculate level-dependant stats */

    mob = create_mobile( get_mob_index( MOB_VNUM_ZOMBIE ) );
    mob->level                  = obj->level;
    mob->max_hit                = mob->level * 8 + number_range(
                                        mob->level * mob->level/4,
                                        mob->level * mob->level);

    mob->max_hit *= .9;
    mob->hit                    = mob->max_hit;
    mob->max_mana               = 100 + dice(mob->level,10);
    mob->mana                   = mob->max_mana;
    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        mob->armor[i]           = interpolate(mob->level,100,-100);
    mob->armor[3]               = interpolate(mob->level,100,0);

    for (i = 0; i < MAX_STATS; i++)
        mob->perm_stat[i] = 11 + mob->level/4;

    /* You rang? */
    char_to_room( mob, ch->in_room );
    act( "$p springs to life as a hideous zombie!", ch, obj, NULL, TO_ROOM );
    act( "$p springs to life as a hideous zombie!", ch, obj, NULL, TO_CHAR );

    extract_obj(obj);

    /* Yessssss, massssssster... */
    SET_BIT(mob->affected_by, AFF_CHARM);
    SET_BIT(mob->act, ACT_PET);
    mob->comm = COMM_NOTELL|COMM_NOSHOUT|COMM_NOCHANNELS;
    add_follower( mob, ch );
    mob->leader = ch;
    ch->pet = mob;
    /* For a little flavor... */
    do_say( mob, "How may I serve you, master?" );
    return;
}

That's it!  Feel free to use it as you please... a little credit 
somewhere would be nice, but not necessary.  Oh, and any improvements 
(*beam*) or bugs (*cringe*), please write to aprocter@mail.coin.missouri.edu.
